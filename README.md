## Description
This is a simple GraphQL server for books that uses Graphene and Django. It is based off of a [tutorial from Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/graphql-apis-django-graphene), but I added a realted model Author and extend the book mutations to include the author info too.

### Motivation
I wanted to dive into GraphQL more after experimenting with it in TypeScript using Apollo and see how it would be like using Graphene.

## Next Steps
I hope to expand this to include more models and more mutations. I also hope to expand this to a project where I am recieving the queries and mutations from a frontend.
